-Loading bridges makes the sliders not work as intended, fix this bug
-In analysis mode, if a vine gets compressed, it should work as a vine would (it only supports tension)
-Freeze game when the bridge breaks, mark the culprit segment with black, maybe even display the cause (too much tension, euler buckling, etc)

-Background by gergő
-Add a few default bridges that can be loaded (at least what we will build)
-Fix sound effects (creaking is weird, some sounds feel delayed, steps should be better, etc)
-Send it over to the bois for beta testing
-Refactor the code, add lots of comments, I should understand it all
-Make it installable
