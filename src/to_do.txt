-Vines don't work
-Fix sound effects (creaking is weird, some sounds feel delayed, steps should be better, not every material has a sound, etc)
-Anti aliasync, hollow has too much hollow
-Add a few default bridges that can be loaded (at least what we will build)
-Background by gergő
-Send it over to the bois for beta testing
-Refactor the code, add lots of comments, I should understand it all
-Make it installable
