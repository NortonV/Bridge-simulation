-Make the hollowness a slider
-Material properties should be stored when saving a design
-In analysis mode, if a vine gets compressed, it should throw a visual error and stuff

-Editor mode bugs (nodes  not connecting when placing, only when moving; etc)
-Fix sound effects (creaking is weird, some sounds feel delayed, steps should be better, etc)
-Nézet váltása és felirat váltása hotkey
-Ne legyen a hollow fix 2cm, legyen slider

-Background by gergő
-Add a few default bridges that can be loaded (at least what we will build)
-Any more features needed?

-Send it over to the bois for beta testing
-Refactor the code, add lots of comments, I should understand it all
-Make it installable
